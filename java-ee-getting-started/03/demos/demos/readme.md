# Module 02: Setting up the Java EE Environment

This module evaluates several tools (editor, building tool, application server, database and testing frameworks), picks up the ones we need for Java EE and makes sure all the tools are correctly installed.


## Demo 

* Make sure the following commands work. This will ensure your Java EE environment is all setup:
* java -version
* mvn -version
* $WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
* Go to the admin console http://localhost:9990/console
* Create a user with $WILDFLY_HOME/bin/add-user.sh
* If you use Intellij IDEA check how to integrate Arquillian at https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/arquillian.html
